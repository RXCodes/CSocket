# Current Status
**CSocket** is not available in hyperPad yet, nor is it complete! I am currently working with the behavior system and the compile feature. I've only started, *(Nov 3, 2020)* and I cannot promise that this project will be successful.

# CSocket Documentation

The code for all the "behaviors" is located in the `framework` folder. They are organized into categories to make things as simple as possible. If you used **CSocket** to compile your project, you do not need to worry about the code at all and you can immediately deploy your project without hassles!

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/RXCodes/CSocket/)

This page only serves as a template -- do not use this project to create your own socket.io server! Compile your own project using **CSocket**!
